# Astro Regression Testing Script

This script is designed to automate regression testing in an Astro project using BackstopJS for visual regression testing. The script disables the Astro development toolbar during tests and re-enables it after screenshots have been captured. The code is currently non-blocking but may change in future versions.

## Prerequisites

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) installed in the project.
- [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) for visual regression testing.
- Node.js installed with `npx` support.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project.
2. Make sure [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS?tab=readme-ov-file#contents) is properly configured in `backstop.json`.
3. Run the script to start the regression tests.

```bash
source ./astro-regression-test.sh
```

## Script Workflow

1. **Disables Astro Development Toolbar**: 
   This improves visual regression testing consistency by removing any interfering toolbar components.
   
2. **Runs BackstopJS Tests**:
   Takes screenshots and compares them to existing reference images to check for regressions.
   
3. **Re-enables Astro Development Toolbar**:
   After tests are complete, the toolbar is re-enabled for further development.

## Future Plans

- **Docker Support**: Future versions of this script will include a Dockerized setup for easier CI/CD integration.
- **Diverse Enhancements**: Plan to add more diverse and configurable options for testing different environments.
